This package requires that gnuradio-core is already installed.  It
also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as boost.

To build the examples from the tarball use the normal recipe:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  (as root) $ make install

If you're building from SVN, you'll need to use this sequence, since
SVN doesn't contain configure or the generated Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  (as root) $ make install

See INSTALL for generic build instructions such as how to tell ./configure that
you want the software installed in a particular location.

See the files in the doc directory for more information.
